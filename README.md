# GifTastic

Here's a great little site that celebrates everyone's love for DOGGOS in gif form. This was our first foray into using api calls. Giftastic allows you to click on existing buttons to load 12 random gif's related to the subject, and to add your own buttons.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University.
